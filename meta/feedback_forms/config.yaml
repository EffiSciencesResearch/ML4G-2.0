form_description: |
  The goal of this form is to allow us to improve ML4Good day by day during the camp, and for the next participants. Thank you for all answers and extra comments.

  More detailed feedback is what helps us the most improve the workshops, both for the other days and the future iterations of the camp. All of it optional, but every bit of information will make someone's life better (yours or future/other participants).

  You can add many bullet points, each of them will help us to gradient descent in the right direction. Examples:
  Not enough talks/guidance
  Too fast
  Instructions unclear
  I'm confused about the material
  I learned a lot
  There was too many details
  (feel free to just copy paste the bullet points that apply!)
