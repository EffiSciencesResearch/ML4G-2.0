# ML4G

This repo contains the instructions for the ML for Good bootcamp, for students and researchers interested in AI safety.

The program is aimed at beginners in machine learning, but is quite ambitious, and we hope that even advanced students will enjoy participating in this program.

## Curriculum ML4Good

We draw inspiration from the redwood mlab, and ARENA, both of which focuses mainly on the ML engineering part.
However there are a lot more workshops on strategy, goverance and conceptual AI safety during the ML4G.
