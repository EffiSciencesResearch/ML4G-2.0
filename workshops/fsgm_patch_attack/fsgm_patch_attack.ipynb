                "In this tutorial, we will discuss adversarial attacks on deep image classification models. As we have seen in many of the previous tutorials so far, Deep Neural Networks are a very powerful tool to recognize patterns in data, and, for example, perform image classification on a human-level. However, we have not tested yet how robust these models actually are. Can we \"trick\" the model and find failure modes? Can we design images that the networks naturally classify incorrectly? Due to the high classification accuracy on unseen test data, we would expect that this can be difficult. However, in 2014, a research group at Google and NYU showed that deep CNNs can be easily fooled, just by adding some salient but carefully constructed noise to the images. For instance, take a look at the example below (figure credit - [Goodfellow et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6572.pdf)):\n",

                "The image on the left is the original image from ImageNet, and a deep CNN classifies the image correctly as \"panda\" with a class likelihood of 57%. Nevertheless, if we add a little noise to every pixel of the image, the prediction of the model changes completely. Instead of a panda, our CNN tells us that the image contains a \"gibbon\" with the confidence of over 99%. For a human, however, these two images look exactly alike, and you cannot distinguish which one has noise added and which doesn't. While this first seems like a fun game to fool trained networks, it can have a serious impact on the usage of neural networks. More and more deep learning models are used in applications, such as for example autonomous driving. Imagine that someone who gains access to the camera input of the car, could make pedestrians \"disappear\" for the image understanding network by simply adding some noise to the input as shown below (the figure is taken from [J.H. Metzen et al.](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017/papers/Metzen_Universal_Adversarial_Perturbations_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf)). The first row shows the original image with the semantic segmentation output on the right (pedestrians red), while the second row shows the image with small noise and the corresponding segmentation prediction. The pedestrian becomes invisible for the network, and the car would think the road is clear ahead.\n",

                "Before we start with our attacks, we should verify the performance of our model. As ImageNet has 1000 classes, simply looking at the accuracy is not sufficient to tell the performance of a model. Imagine a model that always predicts the true label as the second-highest class in its softmax output. Although we would say it recognizes the object in the image, it achieves an accuracy of 0. In ImageNet with 1000 classes, there is not always one clear label we can assign an image to. This is why for image classifications over so many classes, a common alternative metric is \"Top-5 accuracy\", which tells us how many times the true label has been within the 5 most-likely predictions of the model. As models usually perform quite well on those, we report the error (1 - accuracy) instead of the accuracy:"

Specifically, if we look at the ImageNet predictions above, how can we have to change the image of the goldfish so that the model does not recognize the goldfish anymore? At the same time, the label of the image should not change, in the sense that a human would still clearly classify it as a goldfish. This is the same objective that the generator network has in the Generative Adversarial Network framework: try to fool another network (discriminator) by changing its input.\n",

Black-box attacks on the other hand have the harder task of not having any knowledge about the network, and can only obtain predictions for an image, but no gradients or the like. In this notebook, we will focus on white-box attacks as they are usually easier to implement and follow the intuition of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) as studied in lecture 10.\n",

This is exactly the other way round as during training, where we try to minimize the loss. The sign function and $\\epsilon$ can be seen as gradient clipping and learning rate specifically.

In other words, we will create a small image patch that covers a minor part of the original image but causes the model to confidentially predict a specific class we choose. This form of attack is an even bigger threat in real-world applications than FSGM. Imagine a network in an autonomous car that receives a live image from a camera. Another driver could print out a specific pattern and put it on the back of his/her vehicle to make the autonomous car believe that the car is actually a pedestrian. Meanwhile, humans would not notice it. [Tom Brown et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.09665.pdf) proposed a way of learning such adversarial image patches robustly in 2017 and provided a short demonstration on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/i1sp4X57TL4). Interestingly, if you add a small picture of the target class (here *toaster*) to the original image, the model does not pick it up at all. A specifically designed patch, however, which only roughly looks like a toaster, can change the network's prediction instantaneously.\n",

                "Let's take a closer look at how we can actually train such patches. The general idea is very similar to FSGM in the sense that we calculate gradients for the input, and update our adversarial input correspondingly. However, there are also some differences in the setup. Firstly, we do not calculate a gradient for every pixel. Instead, we replace parts of the input image with our patch and then calculate the gradients just for our patch. Secondly, we don't just do it for one image, but we want the patch to work with any possible image. Hence, we have a whole training loop where we train the patch using SGD. Lastly, image patches are usually designed to make the model predict a specific class, not just any other arbitrary class except the true label. For instance, we can try to create a patch for the class \"toaster\" and train the patch so that our pretrained model predicts the class \"toaster\" for any image with the patch in it.\n",

For instance, [Brown et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.09665.pdf) randomly rotated and scaled the patch during training before placing it at a random position in an input image. This makes the patch more robust to small changes and is necessary if we want to fool a neural network in a real-world application. For simplicity, we will only focus on making the patch robust to the location in the image. Given a batch of input images and a patch, we can add the patch as follows:"

Given a model to fool, a target class to design the patch for, and a size $k$ of the patch in the number of pixels, we first start by creating a parameter of size $3\\times k\\times k$. These are the only parameters we will train, and the network itself remains untouched. We use a simple SGD optimizer with momentum to minimize the classification loss of the model given the patch in the image. While we first start with a very high loss due to the good initial performance of the network, the loss quickly decreases once we start changing the patch. In the end, the patch will represent patterns that are characteristic of the class. For instance, if we would want the model to predict a \"goldfish\" in every image, we would expect the pattern to look somewhat like a goldfish. Over the iterations, the model finetunes the pattern and, hopefully, achieves a high fooling accuracy."

If you would compare more patches and models, some would work better than others. However, one aspect which allows patch attacks to generalize well is if all the networks have been trained on the same data. In this case, all networks have been trained on ImageNet. Dataset biases make the networks recognize specific patterns in the underlying image data that humans would not have seen, and/or only work for the given dataset. This is why the knowledge of what data has been used to train a specific model is already worth a lot in the context of adversarial attacks."

                "White-box attacks require access to the model and its gradient calculation. The easiest way of preventing this is by ensuring safe, private storage of the model and its weights. However, some attacks, called black-box attacks, also work without access to the model's parameters, or white-box attacks can also generalize as we have seen above on our short test on transferability. \n",
                "\n",
                "So, how could we eventually protect a model? An intuitive approach would to train/finetune a model on such adversarial images, leading to an adversarial training similar to a GAN. During training, we would pretend to be the attacker, and use for example FGSM as an augmentation strategy. However, this usually just ends up in an oscillation of the defending network between weak spots. Another common trick to increase robustness against adversarial attacks is defensive distillation ([Papernot et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.04508.pdf)). Instead of training the model on the dataset labels, we train a secondary model on the softmax predictions of the first one. This way, the loss surface is \"smoothed\" in the directions an attacker might try to exploit, and it becomes more difficult for the attacker to find adversarial examples. Nevertheless, there hasn't been found the one, true strategy that works against all possible adversarial attacks.\n",
                "\n",
                "Why are CNNs, or neural networks in general, so vulnerable to adversarial attacks? While there are many possible explanations, the most intuitive is that neural networks don't know what they don't know. Even a large dataset represents just a few sparse points in the extremely large space of possible images. A lot of the input space has not been seen by the network during training, and hence, we cannot guarantee that the prediction for those images is any useful. The network instead learns a very good classification on a smaller region, often referred to as manifold, while ignoring the points outside of it. NNs with uncertainty prediction could potentially help to discover what the network does not know. \n",
                "Another possible explanation lies in the activation function. As we know, most CNNs use ReLU-based activation functions. While those have enabled great success in training deep neural networks due to their stable gradient for positive values, they also constitute a possible flaw. The output range of a ReLU neuron can be arbitrarily high. Thus, if we design a patch or the noise in the image to cause a very high value for a single neuron, it can overpower many other features in the network. Thus, although ReLU stabilizes training, it also offers a potential point of attack for adversaries."

                "In this tutorial, we have looked at different forms of adversarial attacks. Deep CNNs can be fooled by only slight modifications to the input. Whether it is a carefully designed noise pattern, unnoticeable for a human, or a small patch, we are able to manipulate the networks' predictions significantly. The fact that even white-box attacks can be transferable across networks, and that there exist no suitable protections against all possible adversarial attacks, make this concept a massive problem for real-world applications. While adversarial attacks can also be used for improving/training a robust model or a GAN, it is not close to being solved yet. This is also because neural networks are currently complex, unknown non-linear functions in high-dimensional looking for correlations instead of causation. In the next years, we might hopefully see an improvement in the stability of such models by using causal approaches and/or introducing uncertainty. "
