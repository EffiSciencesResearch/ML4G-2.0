If not, you can skim that section for an overview of the key concepts. The start of the **Training loop** section is most important, and the subsections on [Modularisation](https://arena-ch0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.3]_ResNets#modularisation) and [dataclasses](https://arena-ch0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.3]_ResNets#aside-dataclasses) are also very useful. Lastly, we'll also be using Weights and Biases to train our model - you can read about how to use it [here](https://arena-ch0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.4]_Optimization#what-is-weights-and-biases). Here are (roughly) all the things you should know for the following exercises:\n",

                "    * `loss.backward()` - calculate gradients of the loss with respect to the model parameters,\n",
                "    * `optimizer.step()` - update the model parameters using the gradients,\n",
                "    * `optimizer.zero_grad()` - zero the gradients so they don't accumulate.\n",
                "* We can nicely package up training loops into a class, which includes methods for training and validation steps among other things. This helps with writing code that can be reused in different contexts.\n",
                "* We can use dataclasses to store all the arguments relevant to training in one place, and then pass them to our trainer class. Autocompletion is one nice bonus of this!\n",
                "    * Be careful of scope here, you want to make sure you're referring to `self.args` within the trainer class, rather than the global `args`.\n",
                "* You can use Weights and Biases to track experiments and log relevant variables. The three essential functions are:\n",
                "    * `wandb.init()` - initialize a new run, takes arguments `project`, `name` and `config` (among others).\n",
                "    * `wandb.log()` - log a dictionary of variables, e.g. `{\"loss\": loss}`. Also takes a `step` argument.\n",
                "    * `wandb.finish()` - called at the end of training (no arguments)."
