                "The learning rate is an example of a **hyperparameter**. A regular parameter is a variable whose value is optimized during the training process. (And because we are using gradient descent for optimization, we must be able to differentiate the loss with respect to the parameters.) The learning rate, in contrast, is not typically determined by this training process. (We cannot differentiate the loss with respect to the learning rate â€” in this case since the learning rate is something that shows up in the definition of gradient descent itself.)\n",
                "\n",
                "One way we might tune hyperparameters is to introduce an outer loop (that wraps around the training loop) to search for good hyperparameter values. This outer loop is called a hyperparameter search. Obtaining results for each combination of hyperparameters requires running the full inner training loop and then checking how well the model does on a held-out validation dataset (which should be different from the test dataset you use to see how good your final model is).\n",
                "\n",
                "Since every iteration of a hyperparameter search involves a training run (each of which might be very expensive), we often do not hope to find an optimum but rather to improve upon our initial guesses enough to justify the cost of the search.\n",
                "\n",
                "In addition, though some hyperparameters are continuous, like the learning rate, they can also be discrete, like the number of layers in the network, type of loss function, type of optimization algorithm, type of learning rate scheduler, and so on.\n",
                "\n",
                "More broadly, every design decision for the training process can be considered a hyperparameter, including how to preprocess the input data, the connectivity of different layers, and so on. What exactly people mean by the hyperparameters depends on the context."
