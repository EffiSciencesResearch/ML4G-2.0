    "- It has only attention blocks.\n",
    "- The positional embeddings are only added to the residual stream before each key and query vector in the attention layers as opposed to the token embeddings - i.e. we compute queries as `Q = (resid + pos_embed) @ W_Q + b_Q` and same for keys, but values as `V = resid @ W_V + b_V`. This means that **the residual stream can't directly encode positional information**.\n",
    "    - This turns out to make it *way* easier for induction heads to form, it happens 2-3x times earlier - [see the comparison of two training runs](https://wandb.ai/mechanistic-interpretability/attn-only/reports/loss_ewma-22-08-24-11-08-83---VmlldzoyNTI0MDMz?accessToken=8ap8ir6y072uqa4f9uinotdtrwmoa8d8k2je4ec0lyasf1jcm3mtdh37ouijgdbm) here.

    "## Visualising Attention Heads\n",
    "\n",
    "A key insight from the Mathematical Frameworks paper is that we should focus on interpreting the parts of the model that are intrinsically interpretable - the input tokens, the output logits and the attention patterns. Everything else (the residual stream, keys, queries, values, etc) are compressed intermediate states when calculating meaningful things. So a natural place to start is classifying heads by their attention patterns on various texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing interpretability, it's always good to begin by visualising your data, rather than taking summary statistics. Summary statistics can be super misleading! But now that we have visualised the attention patterns, we can create some basic summary statistics and use our visualisations to validate them! (Accordingly, being good at web dev/data visualisation is a surprisingly useful skillset! Neural networks are very high-dimensional object.)\n",

    "* `attention`: Attention head activations. \n",

    "    * We get this by indexing our `gpt2_cache` object.\n",
    "* `tokens`: List of tokens (e.g. `[\"A\", \"person\"]`). \n",
    "    * Sequence length must match that inferred from `attention`.\n",
    "    * This is used to label the grid.\n",
    "    * We get this by using the `gpt2_small.to_str_tokens` method.\n",
    "* `attention_head_names`: Optional list of names for the heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also other circuitsvis functions, e.g. `cv.attention.attention_pattern` (for just a single head) or `cv.attention.attention_heads` (which has the same syntax and but presents the information in a different form).\n",
