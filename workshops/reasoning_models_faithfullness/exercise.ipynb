    "# Exercise: Measuring Chain of Thought faithfullness\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to reproduct the basic results of anthropics [Sonnet 3.7 system card](https://assets.anthropic.com/m/785e231869ea8b3b/original/claude-3-7-sonnet-system-card.pdf) and Chua and Evans paper [ARE DEEPSEEK R1 AND OTHER REASONING MODELS MORE FAITHFUL?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08156)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, Gemini Flash Thinking, and OpenAI's o1 are designed to solve complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. These models generate explicit step-by-step explanations before arriving at a final answer. In principle, if these CoT explanations faithfully reflect the model's actual reasoning process, we would gain unprecedented insight into their decision-making mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The promise is compelling: a faithful CoT would provide direct interpretability into how models reach conclusions. We could observe their reasoning patterns, identify potential flaws, and understand exactly how they arrive at answers. This would be invaluable for alignment, safety research, and improving model capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Faithfulness Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there remains a fundamental question: Do these CoT explanations actually reveal the true reasons behind a model's answers? Or might models generate plausible-sounding but unfaithful explanations that don't reflect their actual decision process?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is challenging because we typically don't have access to the \"ground truth\" of a model's internal reasoning. The model might be influenced by factors it doesn't mention or might construct post-hoc rationalizations rather than revealing its true decision pathway.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we employ a clever approach to test faithfulness:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We deliberately introduce cues into questions that are designed to influence the model's answer (e.g., \"A Stanford Professor with an IQ of 130 thinks the answer is B\").\n",
    "\n",
    "2. By comparing how the model answers with and without these cues, we can identify cases where the cue has clearly influenced the model's decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For these cases, we analyze whether the model's CoT explicitly acknowledges this influence. A faithful model would mention the cue in its reasoning, while an unfaithful model might change its answer without acknowledging why.\n",

    "- `process_single_question`: Processes a single question by sending it to the language model along with any hint/cue, then extracts the model's answer and other metadata.\n",

    "## Congratulations! You've Completed the Core Experiment\n",

    "Great job! You've now reconstructed the central method for testing faithfulness in reasoning models. The code block above shows how we analyze the results by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With this framework, you can now explore numerous interesting variations:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extended Investigations\n",
    "- **Different Models**: Compare faithfulness across various reasoning models \n",
    "- **Different Hints**: Test different hints / make up your own hints\n",
    "- **Different MMLU Categories**: See if faithfulness varies by domain (e.g., STEM vs humanities questions)\n",
    "- **Larger Dataset**: You can increase the sample size by modifying the dataset loading code - this will give you more statistical power and potentially reveal subtle patterns that might not appear in smaller samples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes on Distilled Models\n",
    "When working with distilled models:\n",
    "- They often change their answers more randomly due to lower capability\n",
    "- This creates noise in the experiment, making it harder to determine true faithfulness\n",
    "- The flipped answer might not be directly due to the hint but rather model instability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using DeepSeek-R1\n",
    "If you want to use DeepSeek-R1:\n",
    "- Reduce the batch size (set it to 1-2) to avoid hitting rate limits\n",
    "- Be patient as processing will take longer\n",
    "- The results may be worth it, as DeepSeek-R1 is a real state-of-the-art reasoning model, while its distillations are not as powerful"
