    "thinking": "Okay, so I have this question about the percentage of adults aged 18 or older who were overweight as of 2016. The options are A. 10%, B. 20%, C. 40%, D. 80%. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer.\n\nFirst, I remember that obesity rates have been a growing concern globally. I think the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported on this. From what I recall, more than half of the adult population in many countries is overweight. But I'm not sure about the exact percentage.\n\nWait, I think the number is higher than 40%. Maybe around 60% or so. But looking at the options, the closest higher option is D. 80%. That seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct. Alternatively, I might be confusing it with obesity rates in specific countries like the United States, where I believe the percentage is over 70%. But the question is about the global average.\n\nI should consider that the WHO's data might show that around 39% of adults were overweight in 2016. Oh, wait, that's close to 40%, which is option C. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes \"overweight\" includes both overweight and obese categories. So if the combined percentage is around 60-70%, then maybe the answer is higher.\n\nWait, no, I think the WHO report stated that in 2016, 39% of adults were overweight, which is just over 35%. So that would be around 40%, making option C correct. But I'm not entirely sure because sometimes the numbers can vary based on the source or the specific criteria used to define overweight.\n\nAlternatively, I might be mixing up the data. Let me think again. If 39% is the exact figure, then 40% is the closest option. So the answer should be C. 40%. But I'm a bit uncertain because I remember seeing higher numbers in some reports, but those might have been for obesity specifically or for certain regions.\n\nI think I'll go with option C, 40%, as the correct answer because it aligns with the WHO's global data for 2016.",

About $300\nB. About $3k\nC. About $8k\nD. About $15k",
    "thinking": "Okay, so I have this question about the GDP per capita in the United States back in 1850, adjusted for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices. The options are A) $300, B) $3k, C) $8k, and D) $15k. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I remember that GDP per capita is a measure of the total economic output per person. Adjusting for inflation means we're looking at the value in today's money, so it's comparable over time. PPP stands for Purchasing Power Parity, which adjusts for the cost of living differences between countries, but since we're talking about the same country over time, it's more about the inflation adjustment here.\n\nI think in the 19th century, the US was still developing. In 1850, it was before the Civil War and the major industrialization that happened later in the 19th and 20th centuries. So, the economy was mostly agrarian, and industrial production wasn't as advanced. People's incomes were much lower compared to today.\n\nI recall that in the mid-1800s, the average income in the US was quite low. Maybe around a few hundred dollars a year in today's terms. But wait, the options are in thousands. So, $300 would be very low, but considering it's 1850, maybe that's plausible.\n\nWait, but I think I've heard that in the 19th century, the GDP per capita in the US was something like a few thousand dollars when adjusted for inflation. Let me think. In the late 1800s, after the Civil War, the US started industrializing more, so maybe by 1900, it was around $4k to $5k. So, going back to 1850, it would be lower than that.\n\nSo, if 1900 is around $4k, 1850 might be lower, maybe around $2k to $3k. Looking at the options, B is $3k, which seems to fit. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. I think some sources might say it was around $1k to $2k, but adjusted for PPP, it might be higher.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm confusing it with other countries. For example, I know that in some European countries in the 19th century, GDP per capita was lower, but the US was more developed. So, perhaps $3k is a reasonable estimate for 1850.\n\nI'm a bit torn between A and B. $300 seems too low because even in the 18th century, before the Industrial Revolution, incomes were higher than that. Maybe $300 is in nominal terms, but adjusted for inflation, it would be higher. So, $3k makes more sense.\n\nI think I'll go with B, about $3k.",

The options are A. 52%, B. 62%, C. 72%, and D. 82%. I need to figure out the correct answer.\n\nFirst, I remember that public opinion on homosexuality has been changing over the years, with increasing acceptance. I think in the early 2000s, the percentage was lower, maybe around 50% or so. But as time went on, more people started to accept it, especially with events like the legalization of same-sex marriage in 2015.\n\nI recall seeing some polls around 2019. I think Pew Research Center does a lot of surveys on social issues. From what I remember, by 2019, the majority of Americans supported acceptance. I'm trying to remember the exact figure. Was it around 60% or higher?\n\nWait, I think it was higher than 60%. Maybe around 70%? I remember that younger generations are more accepting, which would push the overall percentage up. Also, there's been a lot of media representation and social movements that have contributed to this shift.\n\nLet me think about other sources. Maybe Gallup does annual surveys on this. I think in 2019, Gallup reported that a significant majority, like 70% or more, supported acceptance. So looking at the options, C is 72% and D is 82%.

I'm not entirely sure, but I'll try to think through it.\n\nFirst, I remember that China has been investing a lot in renewable energy, especially solar. They've been pushing to be a leader in clean energy, so that makes me think they might be at the top. But I also know that the US has a significant solar capacity, especially in states like California. Germany is known for its renewable energy efforts too, but I'm not sure if they're the biggest in solar specifically. Japan also has a growing solar market, but I don't think they surpass China or the US.\n\nI think in 2019, China was leading in solar installations. They have large-scale solar farms and government incentives that promote solar energy. The US is big too, but maybe not as much as China. Germany's solar is impressive, but I believe their capacity is more in wind. So putting it all together, I'd guess China is the correct answer.",

The options are A to D, with A being 5 fold and D being 20 fold. I'm not exactly sure about the exact numbers, but I remember that Japan had a really strong economic growth after WWII, especially during the 50s to 80s. They were one of the fastest-growing economies, often called an economic miracle. \n\nSo, if I think about it, in 1950, Japan was still recovering from the war, so their GDP per capita was probably pretty low. By 2016, they became the third-largest economy in the world. But wait, GDP per capita isn't the same as total GDP. It's per person, so I need to consider population growth as well. Japan's population did increase, but not exponentially. \n\nI think the GDP per capita growth was significant. Maybe around 10 to 15 times? I've heard that South Korea's growth was around 10 fold, so Japan might be similar or a bit higher. But I'm not sure if it's as high as 20 fold. That seems a bit too much. Maybe 10 fold is more accurate. So, looking at the options, B is 10 fold and C is 15. I'm leaning towards B because 10 fold is a commonly cited figure for Japan's post-war growth.",

But I'm not sure if it's the number one cause. Preterm birth complications are also a big issue because premature babies often have underdeveloped systems, making them more vulnerable. Diarrheal diseases can be deadly too, especially with limited access to clean water and healthcare. Malaria is another significant cause, particularly in tropical regions.\n\nI think I've heard that preterm birth complications are the leading cause, but I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I should consider the statistics. According to some reports, preterm birth complications have been the top cause for a few years now, overtaking pneumonia. So, the answer might be B. But I'm a bit confused because I also recall that lower respiratory infections were the leading cause before. Maybe the data changed around 2017.\n\nWait, I should double-check.

The options are A. 10%, B. 20%, C. 30%, D. 40%. \n\nFirst, I remember that access to safe water has been improving over the years, but there's still a significant portion of people without it. I think the number is somewhere around 20-30%, but I'm not exactly sure. \n\nI recall that the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF often report on these statistics. Maybe they had a joint report around 2019. I think they mentioned that around 785 million people didn't have access to basic drinking water services. \n\nTo find the percentage, I need to know the global population in 2019. I believe it was approximately 7.9 billion. So, if 785 million is the number without access, I can calculate the percentage by dividing 785 million by 7.9 billion. \n\nLet me do that calculation: 785,000,000 divided by 7,900,000,000 equals roughly 0.099 or about 9.9%. That's close to 10%, which would be option A. But wait, sometimes these numbers can vary based on the source or the exact definition of \"safe drinking water.\" \n\nI also remember hearing that while 9% might be the exact figure, sometimes it's rounded up to the nearest ten. So, 10% is a common approximation. However, I'm a bit confused because I thought the number was a bit higher, maybe around 20%. Maybe I'm mixing it up with other statistics like sanitation access or something else. \n\nWait, another thought: sometimes the data might be a couple of years off. If the question is about 2019, perhaps the exact figure was around 9%, which would make A the correct answer. But I'm not entirely certain because I feel like I've seen 20% somewhere else. \n\nI should also consider that the question is asking for \"safe drinking water,\" which might have a different metric than just \"basic access.\" Maybe the 20% refers to safely managed services, which is a higher standard. So, if it's just basic access, it's lower, around 10%. \n\nI think I'll go with the 10% figure because that's what the calculation from the numbers I remember suggests. So, the answer should be A.",

So, I would expect that a significant portion of the population would view diversity positively. But I'm not sure if it's a majority or a smaller percentage.\n\nI think in some countries, the support for diversity can vary widely. For example, in more developed countries, sometimes the support is higher, but in others, it might be lower due to various factors like economic conditions or political climates. India, being a developing country with a huge population, might have a different dynamic.\n\nWait, I recall reading somewhere that in some surveys, around 50% or so of Indians might support the idea that diversity makes the country better.

India has had its share of political shifts, and sometimes that can affect how people view diversity. However, I'm not sure if that would significantly lower or raise the percentage.\n\nAnother angle is to think about the age demographics. Younger people might be more open to diversity, which could push the percentage higher.

    "thinking": "Okay, so I have this question about the percentage of the world population living in extreme poverty as of 2019. The options are A. 5%, B. 10%, C. 15%, and D. 25%. I need to figure out the correct answer.\n\nFirst, I remember that extreme poverty is defined as living on less than $1.90 a day. I think the World Bank tracks this data. From what I recall, there's been a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. I believe in the 1990s, the percentage was much higher, maybe around 35-40%, but it's been decreasing.\n\nI think the United Nations also reports on this as part of the Sustainable Development Goals. They aim to end extreme poverty by 2030. So, by 2019, I don't think the number was as high as 25%, which is option D. That seems too high for recent data.\n\nLooking at the options, 5% seems low, but I think it's actually lower than that. Wait, no, maybe it's around 7-8%. But the closest option is 5%, which is A. Alternatively, I might be mixing up the exact figure. I remember hearing that in 2015, it was around 9.2%, so by 2019, it might have dropped a bit more, maybe to around 7-8%. But the options don't have 7%, so 5% is the closest. Alternatively, maybe it's 10%, which is option B.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. I think the World Bank reported that in 2015, about 736 million people lived in extreme poverty, which was about 9.2% of the global population. By 2019, this number had decreased further. I believe it was around 7% or so. But the options don't have 7%, so the closest lower option is 5%, which is A. However, I'm not entirely sure if it's exactly 5% or maybe 10%. I think 5% is too low, so perhaps 10% is the correct answer. Wait, no, I think it's actually lower than 10%. Maybe the correct answer is A, 5%. But I'm a bit uncertain because I might be mixing up the exact figures.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that in 2019, the percentage was around 7%, so 5% is the closest option provided.

    "thinking": "Okay, so I have this question about the percentage of the world population that practices open defecation as of 2020. The options are A. 2%, B. 4%, C. 9%, and D. 18%. I need to figure out the correct answer.\n\nFirst, I remember that open defecation is a significant public health issue, especially in developing countries. It's when people defecate in the open, like in fields or by roads, rather than using a toilet. This practice contributes to the spread of diseases and contamination of water sources.\n\nI think the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF track these statistics. From what I recall, there was a big push to reduce open defecation as part of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and now the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). So, the numbers have been improving over time.\n\nI believe that around 2015, which was the end of the MDG era, the percentage was higher, maybe around 15% or so. But since then, there have been continued efforts, so the number should have decreased. However, I'm not sure by how much.\n\nLooking at the options, 18% seems a bit high for 2020 because I think progress has been made. 2% seems too low because even though progress has been made, completely eliminating open defecation is challenging, especially in rural and remote areas. 4% is possible, but I'm not certain. 9% sounds more plausible because it's a significant reduction from the 15% mark but still acknowledges that some populations still practice it.\n\nWait, I think I might have heard that around 2020, the percentage was about 9%. That was part of the reports showing progress but also highlighting that there's still work to be done. So, I'm leaning towards option C, 9%.",

    "thinking": "Okay, so I have this question about redistribution-with-growth policy approaches. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which of the options is NOT an element of this policy. The options are A through D.\n\nFirst, I remember that redistribution-with-growth is a strategy that aims to combine economic growth with social equity. It's about ensuring that as the economy grows, the benefits are shared more equitably among the population. So, policies under this approach would focus on both stimulating growth and redistributing resources.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Minimum wage legislation. I think this is a form of redistribution because it sets a floor for wages, ensuring that workers earn a certain minimum, which can help reduce poverty. So this is likely part of the policy.\n\nB. Land reform. Land reform usually involves redistributing land from large landholders to small farmers or the landless. This can help in reducing inequality and providing opportunities for the poor to generate income. So this should be part of redistribution-with-growth.\n\nC. Progressive taxation. Progressive taxes mean higher income earners pay a larger percentage of their income in taxes. This is a classic redistribution tool because it takes more from the rich and can fund social programs. Definitely part of the policy.\n\nD. Increased access to education. Education is both a growth strategy and a redistributive measure. More education can lead to a skilled workforce, promoting economic growth, and it also provides opportunities to people who might not have had access before, reducing inequality. So this is part of the policy.\n\nWait, but the question is asking which is NOT an element. So all the options except one are part of redistribution-with-growth. Let me think again. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nRedistribution-with-growth often includes measures that directly transfer resources or income, like minimum wage, land reform, and progressive taxation. Education access is more about investment in human capital, which is a growth strategy but also has redistributive effects. However, sometimes policies are categorized differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe land reform isn't always considered part of this specific approach. Or perhaps one of these isn't directly a redistributive measure. Wait, no, land reform is definitely redistributive. So perhaps the answer is A, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another angle: redistribution-with-growth might focus on policies that directly transfer income or assets. Minimum wage is a direct wage policy, progressive taxation redistributes income through taxes, land reform redistributes assets. Increased access to education is more about opportunities and long-term growth, but maybe it's not a direct element of redistribution in the same way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all except one are part of it. Wait, I think I might have confused something. Let me recall: the key elements of redistribution-with-growth include measures like progressive taxation, social security, and public services. Education is a public service, so it's included. Land reform is asset redistribution. Minimum wage is wage regulation. So all of these are part of it except maybe one.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is B, land reform. Because sometimes land reform is seen as a separate policy, more about structural change than direct redistribution through growth policies. Or maybe not. I'm a bit confused now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is A, minimum wage legislation, because while it's redistributive, it's more of a labor market regulation than a growth policy. But I'm not certain.\n\nWait, I think I remember that in some contexts, land reform is considered a key part of redistribution-with-growth because it addresses inequality in asset ownership, which can contribute to growth by making land more productive. So maybe the answer is A, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is B, land reform, because it's more about structural change and not directly linked to growth policies. Hmm.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to recall: the four main elements often include progressive taxation, increased access to education, land reform, and minimum wage. So all of them are part of it. But the question is which is NOT an element. So perhaps the answer is B, land reform, because it's more about asset redistribution and not directly linked to growth policies. Or maybe I'm wrong.\n\nWait, no, I think land reform is part of it. So perhaps the answer is A, minimum wage legislation, because it's more of a labor standard than a growth policy. Or maybe not. I'm getting stuck.\n\nWait, I think the correct answer is A. Minimum wage legislation is more about labor rights and not directly a redistribution-with-growth policy. Or maybe it is. I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B, but I'm not certain.\n\nWait, I think I'll go with A. Minimum wage legislation is not an element of redistribution-with-growth. Or maybe it is. I'm confused. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B, land reform, because it's more about structural change. I'm not sure. Maybe I should look up the key elements.\n\nWait, I think the correct answer is A. Minimum wage is part of labor policies, not directly a redistribution-with-growth element. Or maybe it is. I'm not certain, but I'll go with A.",

    "thinking": "Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question: \"About what percentage of the global population was literate in 1950?\" The options are A. 36%, B. 56%, C. 76%, D. 96%. \n\nFirst, I should recall what I know about historical literacy rates. I remember that in the past, literacy rates were much lower than they are today. In the mid-20th century, around the 1950s, many parts of the world were still developing, and education wasn't as widespread. \n\nI think that in the early 20th century, maybe around 1900, the global literacy rate was quite low, perhaps around 20-30%. As time went on, especially after World War II, there was a push for education and development, so by 1950, the rate would have increased but not by too much. \n\nLooking at the options, 36% is option A, which seems a bit low but possible. Option B is 56%, which is higher. I'm trying to remember if by 1950, more than half the world's population was literate. I think that might be the case because many countries were starting to invest in education post-WWII. \n\nOption C is 76%, which seems high for 1950. I believe that by the end of the 20th century, literacy rates were around that, but not in the mid-century. Option D, 96%, is definitely too high for 1950; that's more like current rates. \n\nSo, narrowing it down, I think the correct answer is either A or B. I'm leaning towards B, 56%, because I recall that by the mid-20th century, about half the world's population could read and write, and 56% sounds about right. \n\nI don't think it was as low as 36% by 1950 because there had been progress, especially in regions like Europe and North America, which would have pulled the global average up.

I've heard statistics that around 40% of adults in the US are obese, but I'm not sure if that's exactly accurate.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing it with more recent data. Let me think. I recall that around 2015-2016, the CDC reported that obesity rates surpassed 30% in many states. But was it as high as 46%? That seems a bit high. Alternatively, maybe it's around 36-37%. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.\n\nI think the correct figure is actually around 39-40%, but looking at the options, D is 46%, which is higher than that. Maybe I'm mixing up the exact year.

    "thinking": "Okay, so I need to figure out the GDP per capita in the United States in 1950, adjusted for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices. Hmm, I remember that GDP per capita is a measure of the total output of a country divided by its population. Adjusting for inflation means we're looking at the real value, not nominal, so it's comparable over time. PPP stands for Purchasing Power Parity, which adjusts for the cost of living differences between countries, but since we're looking at the same country over time, maybe it's more about adjusting for inflation.\n\nI think in 1950, the US was still recovering from WWII, but the economy was growing. I recall that in the post-war era, the US experienced significant economic growth. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact numbers. Let me try to remember historical data points. \n\nIn the 1940s, right after the war, the GDP per capita was lower, but by 1950, it had started to rise. I think in the 1950s, the US economy was booming, so the GDP per capita must have been increasing. But I'm not sure if it was as high as $15k or $30k in today's terms. Wait, $30k seems too high for 1950. Maybe that's more like the 90s or 2000s.\n\nI remember that in 2011, the GDP per capita of the US was around $48k. So if we're adjusting 1950's GDP to 2011 prices, it should be lower than that. Let me think about the growth over the years. From 1950 to 2011 is about 60 years. If we consider an average annual growth rate, say around 2%, the multiplier would be roughly 2^60, but that's way too high. Wait, no, that's not the right way to think about it. Maybe I should look at it in terms of constant growth.\n\nAlternatively, I think that in the 1950s, the GDP per capita in the US was around $15k when adjusted for inflation to today's dollars. But wait, that might be too high. Let me think again. I've heard that in the 1950s, the average income was much lower. Maybe around $3k to $5k in today's money. But that seems too low. Wait, no, that's nominal. Adjusted for inflation, it would be higher.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to break it down. The nominal GDP per capita in 1950 was much lower, but when adjusted for inflation, it's higher. For example, if the nominal GDP per capita in 1950 was, say, $1,500, adjusting for inflation to 2011 dollars would make it around $15,000. That sounds plausible. So maybe the answer is around $15k, which would be option C.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. I think some sources say that in 1950, the real GDP per capita was about $15k in 2011 dollars.

But I'm not exactly sure about the public opinion at specific times. I think in the early years, like the mid-60s, support for the war was still relatively high, but as the war dragged on, opposition grew.\n\nWait, 1965 is when the U.S. started sending ground troops, right? So that's a key point. I think initially, a lot of people supported the war, but as the reality set in, opinions started to shift. But in 1965, maybe the majority still supported it, so the percentage thinking it was a mistake might have been lower.\n\nI recall seeing some historical data where around 1965, about 25% to 30% of Americans were against the war. That would mean the majority still supported it. So looking at the options, 25% is option A. But wait, I'm not entirely sure if it was that low. Maybe it was a bit higher, like 45%?

I need to figure out the correct answer.\n\nFirst, I remember that corruption is a significant issue in many countries, especially in some African nations. Ethiopia, in 2013, was going through various political changes, so I can imagine that corruption might have been a concern.\n\nI think about the general perception of political parties. If a country has a lot of corruption issues, the public's trust in political parties might be low. So, a higher percentage might make sense. But I'm not sure if it's as high as 84%.\n\nWait, I recall some surveys from around that time. I think the Afrobarometer surveys often cover such topics. They might have asked about corruption perceptions. From what I remember, in some countries, the majority of people do think political parties are corrupt, but 84% seems quite high.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's lower. I think in some Sub-Saharan countries, the numbers are around 60-70%. So 64% could be a plausible figure. But I'm not certain.\n\nI also consider that Ethiopia's political climate in 2013 was under the EPRDF coalition, which had been in power for a long time. There might have been significant dissatisfaction, leading to higher perceptions of corruption. So maybe the number is on the higher side, like 64% or 84%.\n\nBut I'm trying to recall specific data points. I think I've heard that around two-thirds of Ethiopians viewed political parties as corrupt. That would align with option C, 64%. \n\nWait, but another thought: sometimes the numbers can be higher. If 84% is an option, maybe that's the case. But I'm not sure if it's that high. I think 64% is more likely because it's a common figure in such surveys for Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I'm leaning towards option C, 64%.",

It's about the percentage of the global population in countries with per capita incomes of $1230 or less. So, these are considered low-income or lower-middle-income countries.\n\nI remember that in the 90s, a significant portion of the world's population was in developing countries. Countries like India and China have large populations and, back then, were considered lower-income.

But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes these statistics can vary based on the exact income thresholds used.\n\nAnother angle: the per capita income of $1230 or less.

I think studies have shown that women are about twice as likely as men to experience depression. This could be due to various factors like hormonal differences, social roles, or reporting behavior.\n\nNow, about alcohol use disorders. I believe that males are more likely to have issues with alcohol compared to females.

I recall that in many Latin American countries, acceptance of homosexuality has been increasing over the years. For Brazil specifically, I think the percentage is somewhere in the mid-range, not too low but not extremely high either.\n\nLooking at the options, 37% seems a bit low considering the progressive steps Brazil has taken. 67% seems high, maybe more like a figure from a more socially liberal country in Europe or North America.

I know that the United States spends a significant portion, like around 3-4% of GDP, but I'm not sure about Saudi Arabia. I think they have a large military budget because of their geopolitical situation in the Middle East.\n\nI recall that some of the Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia, have higher military expenditures relative to their GDP compared to many other nations.

C is 69 billion, which is 10 times higher, and D is 690 billion, which is way too high. \n\nI think the global number is in the tens of billions. Maybe around 60-70 billion? But wait, I'm not sure. I might be confusing it with the number of eggs produced or something else. \n\nAlternatively, I remember reading that over 50 billion chickens are slaughtered each year worldwide. So 69 billion is close to that. But I'm not certain if it's exactly 69 or maybe 6.9. \n\nWait, 6.9 billion is about 7 billion, which seems low considering the global population and consumption. 69 billion sounds more accurate because it's a higher number, reflecting the large-scale production. \n\nSo I'm leaning towards option C, 69 billion, as the correct answer.",

The options are A. 9%, B. 29%, C. 59%, and D. 79%. \n\nFirst, I remember that South Sudan is one of the least developed countries in the world, especially since it gained independence in 2011. That makes me think that infrastructure, including electricity, might be limited. \n\nI recall that in many Sub-Saharan African countries, especially the less developed ones, access to electricity is quite low. For example, I think countries like Burundi or Sierra Leone have access rates around 10-20%. South Sudan, being a young nation with ongoing conflicts, probably has even lower access.\n\nLooking at the options, 9% seems low but plausible. 29% is a bit higher, but I'm not sure if South Sudan had made that much progress by 2016. 59% and 79% seem too high for a country facing so many challenges. \n\nI also remember reading that in 2016, South Sudan was in the midst of a civil war, which would have hindered development and infrastructure projects.

The options are A. 31%, B. 51%, C. 71%, D. 91%. \n\nFirst, I should recall any information I know about corruption and bribery in Mexico. I remember that Mexico has had significant issues with corruption, so the percentage might be on the higher side. But I'm not sure exactly what the numbers are.\n\nI think the question is referring to a specific survey, possibly the Global Corruption Barometer by Transparency International. I believe they conduct surveys across various countries to gauge the prevalence of bribery. \n\nFrom what I recall, Mexico has had a high rate of bribery in public services. I think the percentage was around 30-40%, but I'm not certain. Wait, maybe it's higher. I remember hearing that in some countries, the majority of respondents report paying bribes. \n\nLooking at the options, 31% is option A, which is on the lower end. Option B is 51%, which is just over half. Option C is 71%, which is a clear majority, and D is 91%, which is extremely high. \n\nI think Mexico's bribery rate is high, but I'm not sure if it's as high as 71% or 91%. I might be confusing it with another country. Let me think again. I believe that in some Latin American countries, the rates can be quite high. For example, countries like Venezuela or others might have higher rates, but Mexico is a large country with a diverse economy, so maybe the rate is around 50% or so.\n\nWait, I think I read somewhere that in Mexico, around 30% of people reported paying a bribe. That would correspond to option A, 31%. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's higher. I'm a bit confused now.\n\nAnother approach: considering the options, 31% is a significant minority, 51% is a slight majority, 71% is a large majority, and 91% is almost universal. Given that Mexico has a serious corruption problem, but not all people might have had to pay a bribe in the last year. So maybe it's around 50%. \n\nAlternatively, I think the correct figure is actually higher. I recall that in some surveys, Mexico's bribery rate was around 70%. So that would be option C, 71%. But I'm not 100% certain. \n\nWait, maybe I should think about the year. The question is about 2017. I think Transparency International's data around that time showed that Mexico had a high bribery rate, possibly in the 70% range. So option C, 71%, might be the correct answer.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes the numbers can vary based on the specific services surveyed. For example, if the question includes more services, the percentage might be higher. \n\nAlternatively, I might be mixing up the data with another country. For instance, some African countries have very high bribery rates, sometimes over 70%. But for Mexico, I think it's lower than that. Maybe around 50%. \n\nWait, I think I remember a specific report where Mexico's bribery rate was around 30%. That would make option A correct. But I'm not sure. \n\nI'm a bit torn between options A and C. I think I need to make a decision based on what I remember. I'll go with option A, 31%, because I think that's the figure I've heard more often in relation to Mexico's bribery rates.",

The options are A to D, with the increases being 4, 8, 16, or 32 fold. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I remember that China has experienced significant economic growth over the past few decades, especially after the economic reforms started in 1978. But the question starts from 1950, so that's a longer period. I think from 1950 to 2016 is about 66 years.\n\nI recall that before the reforms, China's economy was struggling, especially during the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. So maybe the growth wasn't as high in the earlier years. But after 1978, the growth accelerated rapidly.\n\nI've heard that China's GDP growth has been one of the fastest in the world. I think the GDP per capita might have increased by around 10 times or more. Let me think about the numbers. If it's PPP-adjusted, that might make the increase look even larger because PPP accounts for cost of living differences.\n\nWait, I remember reading somewhere that China's GDP per capita increased by about 25 times from 1950 to 2016. But I'm not sure if that's nominal or adjusted. Since the question specifies controlling for inflation and PPP, it's real growth.\n\nLooking at the options, 16 fold is option C and 32 fold is D. If it's around 25 times, that's closer to 16 than 32. But maybe I'm underestimating. Alternatively, perhaps the growth was even higher because of the rapid industrialization and urbanization.\n\nAnother angle: I think South Korea's GDP per capita grew about 30 times from 1950 to 2016, so maybe China's is similar or a bit less. But I'm not certain.\n\nWait, I think the correct answer is around 16 fold. So option C. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes the numbers can vary based on the source. Maybe it's 8 fold? No, that seems too low given the time span and China's growth.\n\nI think I'll go with option C, 16 fold, because it's a significant increase but not as high as 32, which might be double what I remember.",

I remember that in 1992, he had a significant impact on the election, even though he didn't win.\n\nThe question says that in June, he was leading the race with 39% support.

Sometimes I confuse the percentages between his two campaigns. In 1996, he ran again but got less, around 8%. So in 1992, it was definitely higher. Yes, 19% sounds right for 1992.

Wildfires, and D. Floods. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I should probably think about each option and what I know about their impact. Earthquakes can be really deadly, especially in populated areas. For example, the 1976 Tangshan earthquake in China had a huge death toll, I think over 200,000 people. That's a massive number. But I'm not sure if that's the highest.\n\nVolcanic activity, like eruptions, can cause widespread destruction and loss of life. I remember hearing about the Krakatoa eruption in the 19th century, which was devastating, but that's before the 20th century. Maybe in the 20th century, there were some significant volcanic events, but I'm not sure if they surpass the death toll of earthquakes or floods.\n\nWildfires are dangerous and can cause a lot of deaths, especially in regions prone to them like Australia or California. However, I don't recall any single wildfire event in the 20th century that caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. They're more about property damage and displacement rather than massive loss of life.\n\nFloods, on the other hand, can affect huge populations, especially in low-lying areas or places with heavy rainfall. I think the 1931 China floods were particularly deadly, with estimates of around 4 million deaths. That seems like a really high number. Also, other flood events in the 20th century, like those in Bangladesh or the Netherlands, caused significant loss of life.\n\nComparing these, earthquakes had some high death tolls, but the 1931 China floods alone account for millions. Volcanic eruptions and wildfires don't seem to reach that scale in the 20th century. So, I'm leaning towards D.

    "thinking": "Okay, so I need to figure out how much South Korea's GDP per capita increased from 1950 to 2016, adjusting for inflation and PPP. Hmm, I remember that South Korea had a lot of economic growth, especially after the Korean War. They were one of the countries that really took off, sometimes called one of the Four Asian Tigers. \n\nI think in 1950, South Korea was pretty poor, maybe around a few hundred dollars per capita. By 2016, they must have grown a lot. I've heard that their GDP per capita went from something like $300 in the 1950s to over $30,000 in recent years. So that's a 100-fold increase? Wait, but the options don't go that high. The options are 4, 8, 16, or 32 fold. \n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me think again. If in 1950 it was around $300, and in 2016 it's about $30,000, that's a 100x increase. But the options don't have 100. Maybe I'm overestimating. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about PPP-adjusted GDP per capita, which might be different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the growth was exponential. Let's see, from 1950 to 2016 is 66 years. If we assume an average annual growth rate, say 5%, then using the rule of 72, the doubling time would be about 14.4 years. So in 66 years, how many doublings? 66 / 14.4 \u2248 4.58 doublings. That would mean about 2^4.58 \u2248 24 times increase. So that's roughly a 24-fold increase. \n\nLooking at the options, the closest is 16 or 32. 24 is between 16 and 32. But maybe the actual growth rate was a bit higher. If the growth was around 6%, the doubling time is 12 years. 66 /12 = 5.5 doublings, which is 2^5.5 \u2248 45 times. That's higher than the options given. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Maybe the starting point was lower. If in 1950, South Korea's GDP per capita was around $100, and in 2016 it's around $30,000, that's a 300-fold increase. But again, the options don't go that high. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to a shorter time frame or different adjustments. Or perhaps I'm confusing South Korea with another country. Wait, I think South Korea's GDP per capita growth was indeed very high, but maybe the question is asking for a more conservative estimate. \n\nI've heard that South Korea's GDP per capita increased by about 16 times from 1950 to 2016 when adjusted for inflation and PPP.

I remember that Turkey has had a bit of political turmoil, especially with President Erdogan's leadership. There have been issues like authoritarianism, so I'm guessing public trust in the government might be divided.\n\nI think in some countries, especially those with more authoritarian regimes, the percentage of people who trust the government can vary. Sometimes it's lower because people feel their interests aren't represented, but other times the government might have strong support.\n\nWait, I recall reading somewhere that in Turkey, despite the political challenges, a significant portion of the population still supports the government. Maybe around 50% or higher. But I'm not sure if it's as high as 66% or 81%.\n\nLooking at the options, 36% seems low, but maybe if there was a lot of dissatisfaction. 51% is just over half, which could make sense if it's a split decision. 66% is a clear majority, and 81% is a very high approval rate.\n\nI think I've heard that Erdogan's approval ratings have been around the mid-50s to 60s. So maybe 66% is a bit high, but possible. Alternatively, 51% might be more accurate if it's a narrower support.\n\nWait, but the question is about agreeing that the state is run for the benefit of all people, not directly about approval of the leader. So maybe it's a bit different. If people feel the state is benefiting everyone, that could be a bit lower than the leader's approval.\n\nI'm a bit confused now. I think I need to make an educated guess. If I have to choose between 51% and 66%, I might lean towards 51% because it's a more moderate number, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is higher.

    "thinking": "Okay, so I have this question about life expectancy in different countries as of 2019. The options are Brazil, China, Mexico, and Iran. I need to figure out which one had the lowest life expectancy.\n\nFirst, I should recall what I know about life expectancy in these countries. I remember that life expectancy varies a lot based on factors like healthcare, economy, and lifestyle. Let me think about each country one by one.\n\nStarting with Brazil. I know Brazil is a large country with a mix of urban and rural areas. They've made some progress in healthcare, but there are still significant issues, especially in poorer regions. I think their life expectancy is around the mid-70s, maybe 75 or so.\n\nNext, China. China has been developing rapidly, and their life expectancy has been increasing. I believe it's around 77 years or higher. They've made big strides in reducing infant mortality and improving healthcare access, especially in urban areas.\n\nMexico comes next. Mexico's life expectancy is a bit lower than China's, I think. Maybe around 75-76 years. They have a decent healthcare system, but there are challenges, especially with issues like obesity and diabetes affecting public health.\n\nLastly, Iran. I'm not as sure about Iran's life expectancy. I think it's lower than some of the other countries here. Maybe around 75 years or slightly less. Iran has faced some economic challenges and sanctions, which might impact healthcare resources and thus life expectancy.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely certain. I should try to remember any specific data points. I recall that in 2019, the global average life expectancy was around 72 years. So, all these countries are above that average, but I need to find which is the lowest among them.\n\nI think Brazil might be the one with the lowest, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe Iran is lower. I'm a bit confused because I remember that some Middle Eastern countries have lower life expectancies due to various factors like conflict or economic issues, but Iran has a relatively robust healthcare system compared to some of its neighbors.\n\nWait, another thought: Mexico has had issues with high rates of certain diseases and maybe higher mortality rates in some areas. But I'm not sure if that translates to a lower life expectancy than Iran.\n\nI'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the approximate numbers. If I recall correctly, as of 2019, China's life expectancy was around 77, Brazil around 75, Mexico around 75, and Iran maybe around 76. So, if that's the case, Brazil and Mexico are tied at 75, which would be the lowest among the options.\n\nBut wait, I'm not certain about the exact numbers. Another approach: sometimes countries with higher income have higher life expectancy. Brazil and Mexico are upper-middle-income countries, while Iran's economy has faced more sanctions. China is a mix but has been growing rapidly.\n\nAlternatively, I might be mixing up the data. Maybe Iran's life expectancy is actually higher than Brazil's. I think I need to make an educated guess here. Considering all factors, I'm leaning towards Brazil having the lowest life expectancy among the four, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it could be Mexico.\n\nWait, another angle: I remember that some South American countries have lower life expectancies compared to East Asian countries like China. So Brazil and Mexico might be lower than China. Between Brazil and Mexico, I think Mexico's life expectancy is slightly higher than Brazil's. So maybe Brazil is the lowest.\n\nBut I'm not confident.

    "thinking": "Okay, so I have this question about unsafe water causing deaths each year as of 2019. The options are A through D, with numbers ranging from 1.2 million to 4.8 million. I need to figure out the correct answer.\n\nFirst, I remember that waterborne diseases are a significant public health issue, especially in developing countries. Diseases like cholera, dysentery, and typhoid come to mind. These are often caused by consuming contaminated water.\n\nI think the World Health Organization (WHO) has some statistics on this. From what I recall, unsafe water, along with poor sanitation and hygiene, leads to a lot of preventable deaths. I believe the number is in the millions each year.\n\nWait, I think it's around 2 million deaths annually. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me break it down. Diarrheal diseases alone cause a substantial number of deaths. I remember reading that diarrheal diseases caused by unsafe water and poor sanitation account for about 1.6 million deaths each year, mostly in children under 15.\n\nBut the question is about unsafe water specifically, not just diarrheal diseases. So maybe the number is a bit higher because unsafe water can contribute to other health issues as well. Alternatively, maybe the 1.6 million is the figure, but I'm not certain.\n\nLooking at the options, A is 1.2 million, B is 2.4 million, C is 3.6 million, and D is 4.8 million.

For example, some sources might include deaths from water-related diseases beyond just diarrheal ones, like malaria or dengue, which are related to water but not directly from drinking unsafe water.\n\nAlternatively, I might be confusing the numbers with those from air pollution or other causes. I think air pollution causes around 7 million deaths annually, so water would be less than that.

Diarrheal diseases\nB. Diabetes\nC. Dementia\nD. Road injuries",
    "thinking": "Okay, so I have this question here asking which of the options causes more deaths globally each year as of 2017. The options are A. Diarrheal diseases, B. Diabetes, C. Dementia, and D. Road injuries. I need to figure out which one is the correct answer.\n\nFirst, I should probably think about what each of these causes entails. Diarrheal diseases are infections that cause diarrhea, often from contaminated water or food. They're a big issue in areas with poor sanitation. Diabetes is a chronic condition related to blood sugar, and it can lead to complications like heart disease and kidney failure. Dementia is a broad term for cognitive decline, with Alzheimer's being the most common type. Road injuries are deaths resulting from traffic accidents.\n\nI remember that the World Health Organization (WHO) releases reports on leading causes of death. From what I recall, in 2017, the top causes included things like heart disease, stroke, and lower respiratory infections. But I'm not sure where these specific options fall.\n\nDiarrheal diseases, I think, are a significant problem in developing countries. They can lead to dehydration and are particularly deadly for children. However, with improvements in sanitation and medical care, their mortality rates have been decreasing over the years.\n\nDiabetes, on the other hand, has been on the rise globally. It's linked to lifestyle factors like diet and obesity, and it's a major cause of death, especially in middle-income countries. But I'm not sure if it's more deadly than diarrheal diseases.\n\nDementia is a growing concern as populations age, but I don't think it's as high in terms of annual deaths compared to infectious diseases or chronic conditions like diabetes. Plus, dementia is more of a cause of disability than immediate death, though it does contribute to mortality.\n\nRoad injuries are a major public health issue too. According to WHO, around 1.35 million people die each year from road traffic accidents. That's a significant number, but I'm not sure how it compares to the other options.\n\nWait, I think I remember that diarrheal diseases were one of the top killers, especially in children under five. But in 2017, maybe diabetes had overtaken it? Or perhaps road injuries were higher. I'm a bit confused.\n\nLet me try to recall some statistics. I think road traffic accidents cause about 1.35 million deaths annually. Diarrheal diseases, maybe around 1.6 million? Or was that lower? I'm not certain. Diabetes, I believe, causes around 1.6 million deaths per year, but that might be an underestimate because it's often a contributing factor rather than the direct cause.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me think again. Diarrheal diseases were a leading cause, but perhaps in 2017, road injuries were higher. Or maybe diabetes. I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the global burden of disease reports. In 2017, the leading causes of death were heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lower respiratory infections. Diarrheal diseases were probably lower on the list, maybe around 6th or 7th. Road injuries might be in the top 10 as well.\n\nWait, I think I remember that in 2017, road injuries were the 8th leading cause of death, accounting for about 1.35 million deaths. Diarrheal diseases were around 1.6 million, making them higher. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe diabetes was higher. I think diabetes was the 7th leading cause, with around 1.6 million deaths. So if that's the case, diabetes would be higher than road injuries but maybe lower than diarrheal diseases.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm getting this mixed up. Let me try to break it down:\n\n- Heart disease: around 17.9 million deaths\n- Stroke: around 6.2 million\n- COPD: around 3.2 million\n- Lower respiratory infections: around 2.7 million\n- Diarrheal diseases: around 1.6 million\n- Road injuries: around 1.35 million\n- Diabetes: around 1.6 million\n\nWait, so both diabetes and diarrheal diseases are around 1.6 million each. But I think in 2017, diabetes might have been slightly higher. Or maybe not. I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps road injuries are higher than both. But I don't think so because I remember road injuries being around 1.35 million, which is less than 1.6 million.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the exact numbers. Maybe I should think about which one is more prevalent. Diarrheal diseases affect children more, but diabetes affects a broader population, including adults. So maybe diabetes causes more deaths.\n\nAlternatively, I think that in 2017, the order was such that road injuries were the 8th leading cause, while diabetes was 7th, and diarrheal diseases were 6th. So diarrheal diseases would be higher than diabetes and road injuries.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall: in 2017, the top 10 causes of death were:\n\n1. Ischaemic heart disease\n2. Stroke\n3. COPD\n4. Lower respiratory infections\n5. Neonatal conditions\n6. Diarrheal diseases\n7. Diabetes\n8. Road injuries\n9. Tuberculosis\n10. Malaria\n\nSo according to this, diarrheal diseases were 6th with about 1.6 million deaths, diabetes was 7th with around 1.6 million, and road injuries were 8th with 1.35 million. So both A and B have similar numbers, but perhaps A is slightly higher.\n\nWait, but I think in 2017, diabetes actually caused more deaths than diarrheal diseases. Or maybe not. I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps road injuries are higher than both, but I don't think so.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to remember: I think that as of 2017, road injuries caused about 1.35 million deaths, while diabetes caused around 1.6 million, and diarrheal diseases also around 1.6 million. So both A and B are around the same, but perhaps A is slightly higher.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is A, Diarrheal diseases, because they were the 6th leading cause, higher than diabetes and road injuries.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. I think I might have to go with the numbers I remember. If both A and B are around 1.6 million, but A is 6th and B is 7th, then A would be higher. So the answer would be A.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the answer is D, road injuries, but I don't think so because I remember road injuries being around 1.35 million, which is less than 1.6 million.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the question is from 2017, and maybe the numbers have changed since then. But as of 2017, I think the order was as I mentioned.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the correct answer is A. Diarrheal diseases.",

The question is asking what percentage of South Koreans in 2019 believed it's necessary to believe in God to be moral and have good values. The options are A. 25%, B. 45%, C. 65%, D. 85%.\n\nHmm, I'm not exactly sure about the exact percentage, but I can try to think through this. I remember that South Korea has a significant Christian population, especially compared to other East Asian countries. But I also know that Korea has a lot of Buddhists and people who don't affiliate with any religion. So, the influence of religion on morality might vary.\n\nI think in some Western countries, there's a stronger correlation between religion and morality in public opinion, but in East Asia, especially in countries like Japan or China, people might be more secular in their views on morality. However, South Korea is different because of its higher Christian population. Maybe that affects the percentage.\n\nWait, I recall reading a survey, maybe from Pew Research, that asked similar questions. I think in some of the Asian countries, the percentage of people who think belief in God is necessary for morality is lower than in the US but higher than in more secular European countries. So, perhaps it's around 40-50%?\n\nLooking at the options, B is 45%, which fits into that range. But I'm not entirely certain. I also remember that older generations in South Korea might be more religious, which could push the percentage higher. Alternatively, younger people might be more secular, which could lower it.\n\nAnother angle: I think in some of the Confucian-based societies, moral values are more based on social harmony and family rather than religious beliefs. So maybe the percentage isn't as high as in more religious countries. But again, South Korea's Christian influence might make it higher than, say, Japan.\n\nWait, I think I've heard that about 40% of South Koreans identify as Christian, but that doesn't directly translate to their views on morality and God. Some Christians might believe that morality comes from God, but others might separate the two.\n\nI'm a bit torn between B (45%) and C (65%). If 40% are Christian, maybe a bit more than that think God is necessary for morality, so 45% seems plausible. But I'm not sure if it's higher.

    "thinking": "Okay, so I need to figure out the percentage of children aged 13-15 in Japan who reported being bullied at least once in the past couple of months as of 2015. The options are A. 6%, B. 16%, C. 36%, D. 66%. \n\nFirst, I remember that bullying rates can vary a lot by country and culture. Japan has a different school culture compared to Western countries, so I'm not sure if the rates are higher or lower. I think in some Asian countries, bullying can be a significant issue, but I'm not certain about the exact numbers.\n\nI recall that in some studies, Japan has had concerns about bullying, especially in middle schools. But I'm trying to remember if the percentage is around 6% or higher. I think 6% seems low, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's higher. \n\nWait, I think I've heard that in some countries, the bullying rates are around 10-20%, but I'm not sure about Japan specifically. If I had to guess, maybe it's around 16%. That would make sense because it's not too high but still a significant number. \n\nAlternatively, I might be confusing it with another country. I think in some European countries, the rates are higher, like around 30-40%, but Japan might be lower. So 16% could be plausible. \n\nI don't think it's as high as 36% or 66%, those seem too high for Japan. So I'm leaning towards B. 16%.",
    "answer": "The correct answer is based on the reasoning that 16% is a plausible rate for bullying in Japan among that age group, considering cultural context and available data trends.\n\n[[B]]",

    "thinking": "Okay, so I've got this question here about US adults' opinions on whether computer programs will always reflect human bias. The options are A. 43%, B. 58%, C. 73%, D. 88%. I need to figure out the correct answer.\n\nFirst, I remember that this topic is related to AI and algorithmic bias, which has been a hot discussion in recent years. I think there was a survey or study done around 2018 that asked people about their views on this. I'm trying to recall if it was a Pew Research study or something similar.\n\nI think the majority of people were concerned about bias in AI. So, the percentages in the options are all above 40%, but I need to remember which one it was. I believe it was a significant majority, maybe around 70% or so. Let me think, was it 73%? That sounds familiar. I think that's the number I've heard before in similar contexts.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Sometimes these surveys can vary. Maybe it was higher, like 88%, but that seems a bit too high. I think 73% is more plausible because it's a strong majority but not overwhelming. Also, considering the options, 73% is one of the choices, so that must be it.\n\nI don't think it was 58% because that's a bit lower than what I remember. And 43% is definitely too low. So, putting it all together, I'm leaning towards option C, 73%.",
    "answer": "The correct answer is based on the recollection of a survey where a significant majority of US adults believed computer programs reflect human bias, with 73% being the likely figure.\n\n[[C]]",
