It [can be proven](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/DirectionalDeriv.aspx) that for an infinitesimal step, moving in the direction of the gradient would increase the loss by the largest amount out of all possible directions.\n",

Intuitively, we can take a larger step if the loss function is flat in some direction or a smaller step if it is very curved. Generally, you could represent this by some matrix P that pre-multiplies the gradients to rescale them to account for the curvature.

In other words, the process of training is a function that takes a dataset, a model architecture, and a random seed and outputs model parameters.\n",

Any particular loss may be completely in the wrong direction of the loss on the entire dataset, but in expectation it's in the right direction. This has some nice properties but doesn't parallelize well, so it is rarely used in deep learning.\n",
                "- Mini-batch gradient descent - the loss function is the loss on a batch of examples of size `batch_size`. This is the standard in deep learning.\n",

                "In addition to choosing a learning rate or learning rate schedule, we need to choose the batch size or batch size schedule as well. Intuitively, using a larger batch means that the estimate of the gradient is closer to that of the true gradient over the entire dataset, but this requires more compute. Each element of the batch can be computed in parallel so with sufficient compute, one can increase the batch size without increasing wall-clock time. For small-scale experiments, a good heuristic is thus \"fill up all of your GPU memory\".\n",

                "At a larger scale, we would expect diminishing returns of increasing the batch size, but empirically it's worse than that - a batch size that is too large generalizes more poorly in many scenarios. The intuition that a closer approximation to the true gradient is always better is therefore incorrect. See [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02677.pdf) for one discussion of this.\n",

                "\n",
                "You will commonly see batch sizes that are a multiple of 32. One motivation for this is that when using CUDA, threads are grouped into \"warps\" of 32 threads which execute the same instructions in parallel. So a batch size of 64 would allow two warps to be fully utilized, whereas a size of 65 would require waiting for a third warp to finish. As batch sizes become larger, this wastage becomes less important.\n",

As you call `torch` functions, PyTorch tracks the relevant information needed in case you call `backward` later on, at which point it does the actual computation to compute the gradient and stores it in the `Tensor`'s `grad` field.\n",
                "\n",

So if your tensor's `grad` already contains a value, after calling `backward` again it will have the sum of the original value and the new gradient. This behavior comes in handy in many situations, such as computing gradients over multiple runs on a GPU as part of a single batch. Suppose you choose a batch size of 32, but only 8 inputs fit on your GPU. A typical loss function for a batch computes the sum of losses over each example, so you can compute the losses 8 at a time and sum their gradients, producing the same result as running all 32 inputs at once.\n",
