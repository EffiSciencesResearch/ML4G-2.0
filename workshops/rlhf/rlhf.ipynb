There are many reasons to think that intelligent systems do not, by default, share human values or that whilst training against any objective will lead to reliable, expected outcomes being produced by AI systems. Nevertheless, training AI systems to produce outcomes that humans prefer over outcomes which they don't seems to be a concrete step towards AI alignment, which we can build on later.\n",

                "\n",
                "Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is a RL technique where the rewards issued by a reward model, which is itself trained from labelled data from a human operator. Often, it can be hard to specify the reward function $R : S \\times A \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that the environment uses to issue reward to the agent, so we ask a human instead to reward/punish the agent based on the action it took. [OpenAI](https://openai.com/research/learning-from-human-preferences) uses RLHF to adjust the behaviour of models to desirable behaviour, but this can also incentivise the agent to hack the reward signal (by taking actions that look good to the human, or influencing the human to always give good rewards.)\n",
                "\n",
                "One should note that in the framework of RLHF, the environment only has one state, and the model that we are trying to fine-tune with RLHF no longer needs to \"plan ahead\", so in this sense it is closer to a bandit problem than the MDPs we saw in previous days.\n",

                "\n",
                "RLHF (at the moment) is a successful method of nudging large language models towards desired behaviour when that behaviour is difficult to write as an algorithm.\n",

                "A simple proxy for offensiveness might even rate this as a positive statement, as it contains \"nice\" words like *love* and *puppy*.\n",

This gives us an autoregressive transformer which has 2 outputs: one corresponding to the standard next token prediction objective, and one which sticks a classifier on the end to get a value function. It does this by adding `self.v_head`, a function which reads from the final value of the residual stream in GPT (which stores some compressed embedding of the prompt), and extracts a value function from this representation. You can think of this as a kind of feature extraction, analogous to the feature extraction that we implemented with our ResNet models in the first week.\n",

The second one is a feature of PPO setup; it makes sure we don't make huge updates from where we were before the last training step (i.e. it's a moving target, used to constrain how much we change each step).\n",

There are times when this is insufficient and you might need to restart the kernel to free up memory, you can call `nvidia-smi` on your terminal to see how much GPU memory is currently being used, and you can run `watch -n 1 nvidia-smi` to constantly keep an eye on GPU utilisation & available memory.
